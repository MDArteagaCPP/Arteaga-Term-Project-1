## About Me

I hold a B.S. in Business Administration, a B.A. in Music Industry Studies, and a Master of Science in Digital Marketing from Cal Poly Pomona.

I am an avid photographer and videographer. I've played the piano since I was 8 years old and continue to produce music as a hobby. I also run a video production business where I've filmed luxury destination weddings, worked with talent from American Idol, and produced content for top Youtube creators.
